Given a keyword, my project retrieves an image from the web.

I chose to include components, objects, apis, and deploy to teh web.

I spent 3 hours developing this project.

Run the site by cloning the repository from my github repository.
Then open the command line interface in the local repository. 
Type in "npm run dev," and the page will be live on localhost:3000.
